Commit
Saves a snapshot of your changes into Git (locally).
Creates a permanent, named “checkpoint”. You can roll back or see differences later. Commits are the backbone of version control.

📝 Step 1 — Create a new repository on GitHub

Log in to your GitHub account: https://github.com/

In the top-right corner, click the + icon → New repository.

Give it a name, e.g. my-first-repo.

Choose Public (so it’s easy).

Do NOT initialize with a README for now (makes cloning simpler).

Click Create repository.

GitHub will show you a page with a URL like:

https://github.com/YourUserName/my-first-repo.git


or SSH version:

git@github.com:YourUserName/my-first-repo.git


Copy the one you want to use.
(I recommend HTTPS to start — easier for beginners.)

📝 Step 2 — Clone the repository with TortoiseGit

In Windows Explorer, create/open a folder where you want the repo locally (e.g. C:\Projects).

Right-click in the empty area → Git Clone…

In the “URL” field, paste your GitHub repo URL (e.g. https://github.com/YourUserName/my-first-repo.git).

Choose a local directory for it (e.g. C:\Projects\my-first-repo).

Click OK.
TortoiseGit will clone it; you now have a local copy.

📝 Step 3 — Add a file

Go to your local repo folder (C:\Projects\my-first-repo).

Create a simple text file, e.g. hello.txt with “Hello Git!” inside.

📝 Step 4 — Commit the file

Right-click inside the repo folder → Git Commit → “master” (or “main”).

You’ll see your new file listed under “Unstaged Changes”.

Check the file you want to commit.

Write a commit message in the box, e.g. “Initial commit”.

Click Commit.

This saves the change locally.

📝 Step 5 — Push to GitHub

After committing, right-click in the repo folder again → TortoiseGit → Push.

In the dialog, make sure “Remote” is origin and branch is main or master (same as GitHub).

Click OK.

It will push your changes to GitHub.
Refresh your GitHub repo page online — you should now see hello.txt.
